Title - Hexgon-Worldmap

Hello Team ,
I have tried to implement all the functionalities provided by the team, I have used d3 library to render the world map.
I have tried to display hexagons using hexbin, but unfortunately I couldn.t render it, as I was working on it for the first time.
I assure you that I will learn all the required functionalities, used to display that map and also other libraries required by the team. 

I have used vercel to host the application,
